# Ari's Windows Tips

I have for maintained a collection of [UNIX Tips](https://github.com/hauva69/arisunixtips) for some years and UNIX type operating system have been my choice for three decades. However, after I started playing correspondence chess on [International Correspondence Chess Federation](https://www.iccf.com/) the open source chess database [Scid vs. PC](https://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/) was no longer quite enough. So instead of installing [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) on my new laptop I left Windows 10 on it, in order to be able to use the premier chess database [Chessbase](https://en.chessbase.com/).
